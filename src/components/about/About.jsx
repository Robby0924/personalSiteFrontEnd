        <h2>I'm an architect turned software developer.</h2>
        <p>
          When I'm not working, you can find me doing a plethora of things. I
          enjoy learning very much and would consider myself a geek regarding
          construction, flight, space, and general science. My hobbies include
          reading, drawing, traveling, and the occasional photography.
        </p>
        <p>I'm currently based in Alpharetta, Georgia.</p>
